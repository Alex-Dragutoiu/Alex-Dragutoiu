# About Me

Hi, my name is Alex Drăguțoiu and I am currently a Master's student at TUM, studying Data Engineering and Analytics. Besides my studies I also work
for Dialog Data as a Software Engineer. 
My hometown is Timișoara, a beautiful city in the Western Romania. 

My passion for Machine Learning started during my Bachelor's at The University of Manchester when I started writing my final year thesis. The subject
of my thesis was rather focused on computational neuroscience which combined two of my favourite subjects. Using the SpiNNaker hardware as a backend, I developed a framework for an ANN to SNN conversion 
using the FS Neuron conversion method. 

Besides my studies, I am the drummer of a deathcore band named Diluvian Collapse based in Timișoara, Romania. I am also playing guitar and hopefully many other
instruments in the future.
